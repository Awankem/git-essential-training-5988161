# How to Write a Commit Message

A good commit message should have:

1. A short summary (50 characters or less)
2. A blank line
3. A detailed description (optional, wrapped at 72 characters)

Example:

Add user authentication middleware

Implemented JWT-based authentication for all API routes.
Updated user model and added tests for login/logout functionality.
